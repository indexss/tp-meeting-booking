### Before the first meeting with TA
- It would be best to meet and get to know each other in advance.
- Create online groups through Discord / Teams / any tool you prefer to use.
- It would be best if the group could coordinate the project topics well. If not, at least each team member should come up with some of their own so that we can dive directly into the discussion.
